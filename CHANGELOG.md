# Changelog

All notable changes to AdsAgent will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.15.1] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- Split `lib/google-ads.ts` (3,703 lines) into 9 focused modules under `lib/google-ads/` for better maintainability: types, client, helpers, reads, writes, campaign-ops, bulk, settings, and barrel index

## [0.2.15.0] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- Impersonation now hard-fails when target session expires (prevents accidental writes to wrong account)
- `resolveAccountId` throws on invalid account IDs instead of silently falling back to default
- OAuth token endpoint enforces `redirect_uri` match per RFC 6749 S4.1.3
- Rate limit bypass in `createCampaign` and `setTrackingTemplate` (API was called before rate check)
- `findKeywordContext` uses `safeEntityId` for consistent validation instead of raw `Number()`
- Guardrail error messages now reference `setGuardrails` (previously referenced unreachable `setGoals`)

### Added
- `setGuardrails` / `getGuardrails` MCP tools for customizing bid, budget, and pause limits per account or campaign
- `DESTRUCTIVE_WRITE_ANNOTATIONS` for bulk/replacement operations (bulkPauseKeywords, bulkUpdateBids, updateAdAssets, moveKeywords)
- `resolveToolAuth` helper to reduce auth boilerplate across 33 MCP tool handlers
- Query cache max-size eviction at 500 entries (prevents unbounded memory growth)
- Parallel pre-check queries in `bulkPauseKeywords` (Promise.all instead of sequential)
- 42 new tests: undo system (23), rate limiting (12), execution layer (7)

## [0.2.14.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- `updateCampaignBidding` MCP tool: change a campaign's bidding strategy (TARGET_CPA, MAXIMIZE_CONVERSIONS, TARGET_ROAS, MAXIMIZE_CLICKS, MANUAL_CPC) with target CPA and ROAS support
- Full undo support for bidding strategy changes via `undoChange`
- Validation guardrails: minimum $0.10 target CPA, positive ROAS required, required params enforced per strategy
- 18 new tests covering all bidding strategies, validation paths, error handling, and protobuf wire format

## [0.2.13.0] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- MCP tool errors now return actual Google Ads API error messages instead of `[object Object]`
- `getResourceMetadata` and `listQueryableResources` now return results (fixed gRPC response destructuring)

### Changed
- All 44 MCP tool handlers wrapped with error boundaries via `safeHandler` for consistent error reporting
- MCP server URL updated to canonical `www.adsagent.org` domain

## [0.2.12.0] - 2026-04-07

- Amber "Viewing as" banner with stop button shows during impersonation

## [0.2.11.0] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- Landing page rewritten for SMB audience: pain-driven hero with mock audit preview, comparison table (Self-Manage vs Agency vs AdsAgent), vertical targeting (Legal, Home Services, Healthcare, Insurance), pricing tiers ($149/$349/$699), FAQ, and conversion-focused CTAs

## [0.2.9.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Account Audit page** (`/audit`) — 7-dimension scoring engine evaluates conversion tracking, campaign structure, keyword health, search term quality, ad copy, impression share, and spend efficiency on a 0-5 scale, weighted to a 0-100 overall score
- Wasted spend analysis with dollar breakdown by category (non-converting keywords + irrelevant search terms) and annualized projection
